1. Enhanced Manager needs orchestration logic:
   - Parse user requests to identify intent
   - Decide delegation strategy
   - Send requests to appropriate agents
   - Process agent responses
   - Maintain conversation context
   
2. Message Broker needs implementation:
   - Implement _agent_worker to process queued messages
   - Add synchronous request/response pattern
   - Handle timeouts and errors
   
3. Agent communication flow:
   - Manager should wait for agent responses
   - Aggregate results from multiple agents
   - Make decisions based on agent feedback
   
4. Task tracking:
   - Manager should track task progress
   - Update conversation based on completed work
   - Report status back to user
