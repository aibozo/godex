# Implementation Status: Current vs Target Architecture

## Summary

The current implementation has the basic structure in place but relies heavily on deterministic logic rather than LLM-driven orchestration. Most agents exist but aren't fully integrated with the intended workflow.

## Component Analysis

### 1. Manager (OrchestratingManager)

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ BaseAgent integration with LLM capability
- ✅ Message broker communication
- ✅ Can talk to other agents
- ✅ Maintains conversation history
- ❌ Uses deterministic intent parsing (`_parse_intent`)
- ❌ Hardcoded workflow paths based on intent type
- ❌ No LLM-based tool calling for orchestration

**Target State:**
- Manager should use LLM to decide which tools/agents to invoke
- No deterministic parsing - let the LLM interpret user intent
- Dynamic workflow based on conversation context

### 2. Planning Agent

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ Uses LLM to create task breakdowns
- ✅ Receives objectives and returns JSON task trees
- ✅ Connected to message broker
- ❌ No integration with RAG for existing codebases
- ❌ No replanning capability based on failures
- ❌ Can't message other agents directly

**Target State:**
- Should request codebase analysis from RAG when needed
- Should handle replanning requests with failure context
- Should produce more detailed task specifications

### 3. RAG Specialist

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ Connected to message broker
- ✅ Executes hybrid_search tool
- ✅ Returns search results
- ❌ Not using LLM for synthesis/analysis
- ❌ Limited to simple search operations
- ❌ No semantic understanding of queries

**Target State:**
- Should use LLM to understand search intent
- Should synthesize search results into coherent context
- Should maintain codebase index for semantic search

### 4. Executor Pool (Coding Agents)

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ Uses LLM for code generation
- ✅ Basic task execution
- ✅ Returns success/failure
- ❌ No detailed failure reporting
- ❌ No integration with provided context
- ❌ Limited tool access (only write_diff mentioned)

**Target State:**
- Should use full context from RAG
- Should provide detailed failure summaries
- Should have access to all coding tools

### 5. Message Broker

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ Basic message routing works
- ✅ Request/response pattern
- ✅ Agent registration
- ✅ Stats tracking

**Target State:**
- Already meets requirements

### 6. Tools Integration

**Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ Tools exist in `agent/tools/`
- ✅ BaseAgent has `execute_tool` method
- ❌ Manager doesn't use tools for orchestration
- ❌ Limited tool access for agents

**Target State:**
- Manager should have "message_agent" or similar tools
- All agents should have appropriate tool access

## Key Gaps to Address

### 1. Manager Orchestration (Priority: HIGH)
- Remove deterministic intent parsing
- Implement LLM-based tool calling for agent orchestration
- Add tools for messaging each agent type

### 2. Inter-Agent Communication (Priority: HIGH)
- Planning Agent needs to message RAG
- Manager needs structured tools for each agent
- Implement proper request/response schemas

### 3. Context Flow (Priority: MEDIUM)
- RAG should build context for Planning Agent
- RAG should build context for each execution task
- Context should flow through the pipeline properly

### 4. Failure Handling (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Coding agents need detailed failure reporting
- Planning Agent needs replanning capability
- Manager needs to handle the full failure flow

### 5. Tool Access (Priority: LOW)
- Expand tool access for each agent type
- Ensure agents can use appropriate tools

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Fix Manager Orchestration**
   - Replace `_parse_intent` with LLM-based decision making
   - Add agent communication tools
   - Let Manager decide workflow dynamically

2. **Enhance RAG Integration**
   - Add LLM-based query understanding
   - Implement context building for Planning and Coding agents
   - Ensure semantic search works properly

3. **Complete Planning-RAG Loop**
   - Allow Planning Agent to request codebase analysis
   - Implement replanning with failure context

4. **Improve Execution Flow**
   - Add detailed failure reporting to Coding Agents
   - Implement proper context usage in execution
   - Complete the execution-feedback loop

5. **Polish and Test**
   - End-to-end testing of all workflows
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling improvements
